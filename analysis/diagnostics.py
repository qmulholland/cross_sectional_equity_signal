"""
Diagnostics.py serves as a "checker" to make sure that the end-to-end
pipeline is functioning without any code crashes. It allows the user
to verify (quickly) that the data flows correctly from the loader
into the backtester before committing to full-scale performance analysis.

In the future, it can be expanded into a testing unit that checks for 
data gaps, signal decay, or correlation thresholds. This would provide 
an early "warning" for "broken" signals that could lead to misleading
backtest results.
